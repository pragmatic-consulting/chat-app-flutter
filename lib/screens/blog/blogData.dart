        "Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that there will be a county fair and a factory tour in October at the company's new electric vehicle plant in Germany. "
            "Elon Musk said Tesla's new factory in Germany will be open for a tour in October. "
            "The tour will prioritize residents but the general public will also be invited, he said. "
            "During his visit to the site this week, he said car production should kick off there in October. "
            "See more stories on Insider's business page. "
            "Elon Musk on Friday invited residents and the general public to a tour of Tesla's new Gigafactory outside of Berlin, Germany. "
            "Giga Berlin-Brandenburg county fair & factory tour on 9 October! the Tesla CEO tweeted. "
            "Musk said Tesla will prioritize residents of Brandenburg and Berlin for the tour around the battery and electric vehicle plant, but the general public will also be able to visit. "
            "Tesla didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. "
            "The billionaire announced the Gigafactory tour on the same day that he met with German leaders and visited the site in Gruenheide, east of Berlin. "
            "During his trip, he said he hopes Tesla will start producing cars at the factory in October, according to a Reuters report. "
            "We're looking forward to hopefully getting the approval to make the first cars, maybe in October if we are fortunate, Musk said, per Reuters. "
            "Tesla is still waiting for the green light from Brandenburg's environmental authorities to open the site, Insider's Hannah Towey reported on Friday. "
            "The Gigafactory was supposed to open on July 1 but environmental activists, permit delays, and lizards on the site put its opening date behind schedule. "
            "Since Tesla started building the factory in early 2020, Grüne Liga, a local environmental group, has argued that the site could threaten the area's drinking water. "
            "This region has so much water, look around you, Musk said on his visit to the factory on Friday, per Reuters. It's like water everywhere here. Does this seem like a desert to you? he said. ",

        "Indian Government Asks Elon Musk's Tesla For Detailed Manufacturing Plans Before Tax Cut On Electric Vehicles",
        "Earlier this month, the ministries of heavy industries and finance sought the details from Tesla even as the government examines billionaire Elon Musk’s demand for lower taxes on EVs in Asia’s third-largest economy. The information was revealed by a person who wished to remain anonymous due to the private nature of the matter. "
        "The departments have also asked Tesla for its thoughts on importing fully built cars versus so-called knocked-down units or partially built vehicles, which attract a lower import levy. "
            "Tesla didn’t respond to requests for comment. Representatives from India’s Ministry of Heavy Industries and the nation’s Ministry of Finance couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. "
            "Tesla wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government in July asking for the import duty on electric cars to be reduced to 40% from the current 60% to 100%. The company also asked for the 10% social welfare surcharge -- which is levied on all imported cars and helps fund health and education programs -- to be scrapped.",

        "Jervois Global Limited (OTCPK:JRVMF) has been very busy and aggressive in its drive to create a pure play battery metals company. The company’s name change from Jervois Mining to Jervois Global Limited is more than just semantics in my view as the company has quickly gone from primarily a battery metals (cobalt and nickel) miner to a fully integrated battery metals provider with an industrial component via its refineries in Brazil and now Finland. "
            "One striking thing about Jervois has been the speed at which it's been able to grow its capabilities as well as the shrewd fashion in which it has done it. In the span of less than four years since the appointment of Bryce Crocker in September 2017 it has acquired the only US source of cobalt (Idaho Cobalt Operations, ICO), acquired an established nickel and cobalt producer in Brazil and now completed its biggest move to date the acquisition of Freeport Cobalt. "
        "At the same time Mr. Crocker has hired and built an impressive management team comprised largely of former Xstrata and Glencore (OTCPK:GLCNF) executives who have experience running much larger operations. Jervois’s vision has been focused on many key themes that should appeal to investors including battery metals for the rapidly growing EV market, ESG compliance via ethically sourced and produced cobalt which is rare, and rapid growth. The end result is that Jervois is now poised to be the second largest cobalt producer in the world outside of China. "
        "That said the company was essentially in the pre-revenue phase prior to the acquisition of Freeport which now gives it an existing revenue and profit stream that will be augmented in coming years by its Idaho Cobalt Operations and restart of its Brazil refinery. Jervois is not without risks; however, the company has demonstrated in a relatively short period of time that it is aggressive, shrewd and capable of growing quickly. The caliber of the management team for the size of the company is also impressive. I recommend that the risk tolerant investor add Jervois to their portfolio.",

        "Ford Motor Co said late on Friday it will ask the U.S. Patent Office to rescind trademarks obtained by rival General Motors Co for the terms Cruise and Super Cruise, escalating a brawl GM began by suing Ford over its use of Blue Cruise for an automated driving system. "
            "The legal fight between the two Detroit automakers turns on whether cruise is a generic term for technology that allows the car to take over some share of driving tasks from a human motorist. "
        "The clash underscores the intensity of competition among established automakers to be seen as leaders in automated driving technology, competitive with Silicon Valley rivals Tesla Inc, Alphabet Inc 's Waymo unit and others. "

        "How to Invest Without a Crystal Ball",
        "The CXO Advisory Group once looked at thousands of stock market predictions by dozens of financial gurus over a 15-year period. It found that the gurus (ie, public commentators) were only correct around 47 percent of the time; on average, an investor would have been better off simply flipping a coin. Gurus get paid for having an opinion, not for being correct. In fact, marketed properly, one good (or perhaps lucky) prediction can cement a commentator’s reputation for decades. However, the truth is that “nobody knows nuthin’.” When investors realize there is no reliable resource out there that will give them the future returns of various investments or the direction of interest rates, it can be an immensely freeing experience. "
            "All of a sudden, those investors realize trying to game the system is a waste of time and energy. Instead, they can concentrate on the factors they can control, such as how much they earn, how much they save, and their overall mix of investments. "
            "Some people think they really can make good predictions. I propose an exercise. Get a notebook. Every time you have a prediction about the future performance of a particular investment, write it down. Be specific. Don’t just write, “I think Tesla will do well "
            "Do the same thing with interest rate projections, housing prices, inflation, and anything else that you think you can predict with any degree of accuracy. Circle back and see how many of your predictions turned out to be correct. Within a year or two, you will likely convince yourself that your crystal ball is just as cloudy as anyone’s. As investors, we are not always rational. Retrospectively, we believe it was much easier to predict the future than it was. Only honest evaluation of an exercise like this can reveal that bias.",

        "I’ve gotten used to the Tesla Service experience quite quickly. After almost two years of Tesla Model 3 ownership, I’ve started to forget what’s special about it and take it for granted. But some recent stories, combined with a couple of recent service visits, got me thinking about it again. As I was thinking about it, I realized I’ve never actually written about what I love about Tesla Service so much "
            "What’s especially nice about Tesla Service — the #1 thing I like about it — is that I don’t have to worry about Tesla ripping me off to stuff some more cash in its pockets. Everyone knows the story — your local friendly mechanic is a master of getting you to spend far more money than you need for him to “fix something.” Everyone knows that you have to negotiate/haggle with these guys, but the vast majority of us don’t know how to. It’s annoying, stressful, and disheartening. No one wants to have to go get service done on their car, and the communication with the mechanic is one of the most dreadful parts of it all. "
            "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that he doesn’t want Tesla Service to be a profit center. Ideally, Tesla Service will just barely make money. Elon wants the company to offer an honest, fair price for service that just covers the cost of goods and the labor. We’ll have to come back to some of those stories at a later date. "
            "So, yes, thing #1 is that I don’t have to worry about Tesla Service taking advantage of me or boosting its bottom line at my expense. I don’t have to negotiate with the Tesla Service technician. I can trust that Tesla has no reason to do more than it has to, and has no reason to charge more than the parts and labor cost ",
